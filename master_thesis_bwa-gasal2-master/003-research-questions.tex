In the sections above, we detailed the alignment problem and how GPUs can help in solving it in a timely manner. The heart of the problem addressed in this thesis is how to accomplish this task. We can formulate this in the following research questions.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can we accelerate DNA alignment in an already existing program?
	\item How much speed-up can we get from GPU acceleration?
	\item How close can the results with a different computing method be to the original software?
	\item How to ensure that the GPU resources are well used while leaving more space if needed for future evolution?
\end{itemize}
