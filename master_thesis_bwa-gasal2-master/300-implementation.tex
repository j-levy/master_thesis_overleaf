In this chapter, we will review the choices we made for the implementation of the features discussed earlier. We will focus on what feature is implemented, how it was written, and why we chose to implement things the way they are. Although some code snippets are provided, a closer look to the program as a whole~\cite{j-levy:bwa-gasal2} can be helpful to understand the coupling between different parts of the software.
