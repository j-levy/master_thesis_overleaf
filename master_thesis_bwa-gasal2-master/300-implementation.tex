In this chapter, we will review the choices we made for the implementation of the features discussed earlier. We will discuss how various features are implemented in GASAL2. Although some code snippets are provided, the detailed implementation is available at~\cite{j-levy:bwa-gasal2} and reviewing it can be helpful to understand the coupling between different parts of the software.
