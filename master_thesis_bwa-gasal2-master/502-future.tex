Concerning what lies ahead, the first notice is about bwa-gasal2 licensing. Originally, BWA is under GNU General Public License v3.0 and GASAL2 is licenced under Apache 2.0 License. Because of the licence choice of BWA, projects including it must follow the GPL v3.0, providing full source code disclosure. It follows that bwa-gasal2 will get the same license to respect BWA original rights; this includes leaving the source open for anyone to see. This means that any volunteer can contribute or fork the project to enlarge it, provided they ship it with the same license.

The first feature that would be highly valuable in bwa-gasal2 is seeding acceleration. As we have seen, seeding is the more lengthy step, taking approximately half of the time for short sequences. It is crucial to implement acceleration for it to gain major speed-up for the program as a whole. 

Other optimisation can be designed, in particular to the extension kernel. Any optimisation done at this level could have serious repercussions on the total execution time. For example, one could implement data packing on a 3-bit encoding, to save more memory and compute the dynamic programming matrix by tiles of $10 \times 10$ bases. It would be interesting whether this could bring a noticeable speed-up.
