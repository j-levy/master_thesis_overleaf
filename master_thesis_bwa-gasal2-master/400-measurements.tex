We are now ready to test our software for short DNA reads produced by Illummina sequencing machines. BWA-MEM is the industry standard for mapping short DNA reads. We will first review our testing environment and the data set we use for the rest of this thesis. Then we will show the performance improvement we get from the acceleration. In the best cases we can drastically reduce the extension time due to CPU-GPU overlapped execution. We will take a closer look to the results validity and the difference between our solution and the original BWA-MEM. Finally, we will show the resource use with our sample data to give the reader a glimpse of the requirements of our solution.
