We are now ready to test our software. We will first review our testing environment and the data set we used for the rest of this thesis. Then we will show the performance improvement we can get from this acceleration. In the best cases we can drastically reduce the extension time thanks to CPU-GPU overlapped execution. We will take a closer look to the results validity and the difference between our solution and the original BWA. Finally, we will show the memory use with our sample data to give the reader a glimpse of how much our solution requires.
