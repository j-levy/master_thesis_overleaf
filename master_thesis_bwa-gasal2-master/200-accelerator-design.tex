The following chapter is dedicated to acceleration of the seed-extension, or simply called \emph{extension} part and its integration in BWA-MEM. To do this, we developed a CUDA kernel for extension in the GASAL2 library. Then, we integrated the kernel in BWA-MEM to accelerate it.
We will first show that extension acceleration can bring a substantial benefit to BWA-MEM performance. Then we will present the current state of GASAL2, the CUDA library for DNA sequence alignment, with its possibilities and shortcomings. We will formulate the specifications for this integration and how to verify them.
