The following chapter is dedicated to acceleration of the extension part and its integration in BWA. To do this, we developed an CUDA kernel for extension in the GASAL2 library. Then, we implemented this piece of software into BWA to accelerate it.
We will first show that extension acceleration can bring a substantial benefit in BWA. Then we will present the current state of GASAL2, the CUDA library for DNA alignment, with its possibilities and shortcomings. We will formulate the specifications for this integration and how to verify them.
